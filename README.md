CryptoChecker Telegram Bot
CryptoChecker is a Telegram bot that allows users to retrieve real-time cryptocurrency prices, market data, and sentiment analysis through a simple /crypto command. The bot fetches data from the CoinGecko API, generates a visually appealing image displaying the cryptocurrency's price, market cap, volume, circulating supply, and sentiment. The sentiment is analyzed using TextBlob, based on a placeholder news sentence related to the cryptocurrency.
